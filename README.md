# World One School — Sports Fest 2026 (React)

This is a client-side React app scaffolded to implement an animated premium website.

Quick start:
1. Ensure you created the project with Create React App:
   npx create-react-app world-one-sports
   cd world-one-sports

2. Replace src/ and public/index.html with the files above (or paste them into those paths).

3. Install runtime deps:
   npm install
   npm install framer-motion react-router-dom

4. Start dev server:
   npm start

Notes:
- Use npm start (CRA default). Do not run npm run dev unless you add a dev script to package.json.
- Animations respect reduced-motion preferences.
